            <h2>Why are they called roguelikes?</h2>
            <p>It's probably best to get it out of the way first, so let's just address it right away: “roguelike” is a
                pretty terrible and peculiar name for a genre. It would be unusual these days to hear a “first person
                shooter” be referred to as a “Doom clone”, and we don’t call tennis games “ponglikes”. Yet gaming
                culture has decided, collectively, upon the name roguelike for one of its most significant genres; so I
                guess that's what we’re stuck with for now. </p>
            <p>
                Rogue itself was a turn based “dungeon crawler” released in the early 1980s, using simple ascii
                characters to depict its world, crucially however that world was different every time the game was
                played; it was procedurally generated. It's the procedural generation of a game’s levels or world that
                has become one of the two defining features of the modern roguelike genre.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other defining feature of the genre is known as “permadeath” (continuing the theme of ridiculous
                terms), and this simply means that when the player character dies, the player must start the whole game
                again. Of course, this would be rather frustrating if the player had to make their way through all the
                same levels over and over again; but if the levels are procedurally generated this need not be a
                problem, the player can be presented with a fresh challenge each time.

            <h2>What makes them special?</h2>
            <p>You walk into the great decrepit atrium of some vast temple built by a long gone civilisation, you’re
                tense as you can hear occasional muffled sounds indicating you are not alone. Suddenly a hideous
                creature emerges from behind a column as you walk past, before you have a chance to react it knocks you
                across the room. It charges at you, but by some miracle of your own reflexes you manage to dodge it.
                Frantically scanning the room you see part of the floor has collapsed to reveal a deep abyss. You bait
                it towards the precipice. The monster makes one more charge towards you. At the very last second you
                leap to the side, one of the creature’s horrendous claws catches your back, tearing away a chunk of
                flesh as it flies past you. A screeching cry reverberates in your ear drums as the monster falls into
                the inky blackness below. You use the last of the first aid supplies you have, patching yourself up as
                best as you can, you’ve survived, but only just, and who knows what is lurking deeper in the temple.
            </p>

            <p>In a “traditional” game at this point you might well see how weak a position you are in and decide the
                best thing to do is to reload the level and try it again. But doing this replaces your nail-biting,
                dramatic escape sequence with a tedious scene in which the hero inexplicably knows exactly what’s coming
                next and never seems to get hurt.
            </p>

            <p>
                A great roguelike discourages the temptation to strive for perfection, and instead invites a player to
                embrace imperfection, chaos, and even outright failure. When one is playing a roguelike, every run
                through the game can be its own independent story, no more or less valid for whether it ends with saving
                the universe or dying in a ditch.
