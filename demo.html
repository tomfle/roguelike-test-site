                Thinking back to my childhood, one of the first games that I encountered which featured the concepts
                I’ve discussed on this site (procedural generation and permadeath), was the flash game “Helicopter”. The
                game was comically popular in my school’s IT rooms, and I can distinctly remember classmates making bold
                claims about their high scores. It's more than a bit of a stretch to refer to Helicopter as a roguelike
                considering it’s essentially an arcade game; but there is that core idea of replayability, of trying to
                master the admittedly extremely simple mechanics rather than just a specific level or map.

            </p>

                Anyway that’s my excuse for making the above - very much Helicopter inspired - demo, that and and as an
                exercise to dust off my extremely rusty javascript skills.
