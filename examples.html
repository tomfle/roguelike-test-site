                    <h2>Spelunky</h2>
                    <p>
                        Your humble author on this site is not one who likes to indulge in overstatement and
                        exaggeration (or tautology for that matter), so it is with the greatest of caution when I say
                        that when Derek Yu released Spelunky back in 2012 it represented the single greatest cultural
                        and technological achievement in the history of our species.
                    </p>

                    <p>Spelunky may at first glance appear to be quite a simple platformer, but when playing and
                        re-playing through its ever changing caves, players will begin to notice how almost every
                        element of the game interacts with every other one. For instance the player may well set off an
                        arrow trap, but so might one of the game’s many infernal bats; for that matter it could just be
                        a lowly rock that sets the arrow flying. The rock itself might have been set in motion by an
                        explosion, perhaps caused by a proximity mine…which itself may have been triggered by a curious
                        yeti. It might sound a little silly, but these small, ridiculous, brilliant elements quickly
                        start to combine into emergent narratives; and thanks to the game’s procedural generation there
                        are always new stories to be had on the next play through.</p>

                    <h2>Downwell</h2>
                    <p>Downwell is a stunning piece of minimalist game design that feels absolutely fantastic to play.
                        The premise couldn’t get much simpler: your dog has fallen down what turns out to be an
                        extraordinarily deep well and you need to rescue them - what more motivation could you need?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The simplicity and purity of Downwell is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that there are
                        only 3 buttons for the whole game, and two of those are for moving left and right! The third
                        button is where the developer has been really rather clever, combining the player’s jump and
                        shoot actions into one; the first tap of the button sees the player jump, then subsequent taps
                        will fire shots beneath the player while allowing them to control their fall. It is amazing how
                        much depth the game wrings out of such a simple mechanic.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Downwell is also a great demonstration of how well the core roguelike mechanics can work to
                        create an amazing player experience. When first playing the game, getting through some of the
                        lower levels of the well seems to be utterly impossible, but almost every time you play, you can
                        feel yourself internalising its simple and satisfying ruleset.

                    <h2>In to the Breach</h2>
                    <p>
                        Into the Breach is a fascinating roguelike strategy and tactics game; it sees the player
                        commanding a trio of gigantic robots as they valiantly attempt to save humanity from an army of
                        colossal killer bugs.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Like the other games mentioned here, Into The Breach, uses its roguelike structure to encourage
                        players to learn and engage with the game’s core systems, rather than trying to learn levels by
                        rote.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The twist on this occasion is that the player can see what the bugs are going to do on their
                        next turn, and plan their own moves accordingly. Initially this seems to merely allow the player
                        to get out of the way of incoming attacks, but before long they’ll see that they can use their
                        enemies moves to their own advantage. If there's anything more diabolically satisfying than
                        getting two giant alien scorpions to attack one another, then frankly, I don’t want to know
                        about it.
